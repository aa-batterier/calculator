# Stack calculator.

A calculator who uses two stacks, one for the numbers and the other for the operators.
Right now this is just a very simple calculator, who can only count with +, -, /, * and ^.
In the future if I have time I would want to add more operators and make paranterser work.
To run it in terminal mode write terminal as an argument.
